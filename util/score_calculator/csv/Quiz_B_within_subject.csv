I say Ok Google when I'm driving and I need a gas station along the route. The reason I need it is because my hands are not available. If I have any chance to type using keyboard, I'll never talk to a virtual assistant because it's more precise and it saves time. I even don't want to use the mouse at all if I can do the same thing with a keyboard because it saves time. QuizBot is better in this case because I can type words instead of speaking to it. But honestly, since all functions of a quizbot is also there on flashcard app, it doesn't make much sense to use a chatbot which is not as efficient as flashcard app (because I have limited choices and have to wait for replies). But one thing that quizbot is absolutely useful is analyzing users' input and match that with correct answer. That's something a simple flashcard won't do.
